                <h2>What is Fantasy Football?</h2> 
                <p>Fantasy football is a <em>virtual game</em> where participants act as team managers, assembling rosters made up of real-life <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> players. Each week, your team's <strong>performance</strong> is determined by the actual statistics of your players during their games. Points are awarded based on their yardage, touchdowns, and other contributions. The goal is to outscore your opponent by making strategic decisions, such as choosing the best starters or trading for stronger players. It's an exciting way to engage with football, mixing real-life stats with fantasy strategy!
                This website will help you understand and potentially prepare for fantasy football, <strong>however</strong>, fantasy football is as much a game of chance as it is strategy so <mark>this guide will not guarantee success.</mark></p>

                <p>Each fantasy league is set up differently, but the traditional scoring system remains fairly consistent across most formats. Points are awarded based on player performance in key areas such as touchdowns, yardage, and receptions. Understanding how scoring works is crucial to drafting a competitive team and making in-game decisions. Below is a breakdown of the common scoring categories in fantasy football:</p>

                <p>Quarterbacks are often the cornerstone of a fantasy team, as they typically score the most points on a consistent basis. The best fantasy quarterbacks, like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, are dual-threat players who can accumulate points through both passing yards and rushing yards. Important stats to watch for include touchdown passes, rushing touchdowns, and completion percentages.</p>

                <h3>Wide Receivers</h3>
                <p>Wide receivers are your top point scorers in many formats, especially in leagues where receptions matter. Players like Justin Jefferson and Tyreek Hill stand out due to their ability to rack up receptions and  <abbr title="Yards After Catch">YAC</abbr>. In addition to touchdowns, watch for targets and yards per catch to identify top performers.</p>
