                <p>Accessible design is more than a technical requirement, it is an ethical, business, and legal obligation. In the world, over 1 billion people have a form of disability, which represents a significant portion of the population. By excluding accessible design, you alienate a large group of users who rely on assistive technologies and clear navigation to engage with online content.</p>

                <p>Accessibility also aligns with principles of universal design, ensuring that your website is usable by the widest audience possible, regardless of ability or disability. By following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), you not only meet legal requirements, but also create a user experience that is inclusive and engaging.</p>

                <h2>Inclusivity</h2>

                    </figure>
                
                <p>Inclusivity in web design ensures that no one is excluded due to physical, cognitive, or technological barriers. According to the W3C, people with disabilities face a wide array of challenges ranging from inaccessible navigation to poor contrast ratios. An inclusive design allows everyone, young or old, disability or not, can seamlessly and easily access and interact with your site.</p>

                <p>Inclusive design reflects an ethical commitment to equality and ensures your website respects the diversity of human abilities. By embracing the 7 Principles of Universal Design, such as equitable use and simplicity, you not only support those with disabilities but also improve usability for all users.</p>

                <p>Failing to prioritize accessibility can have serious legal repercussions. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that websites be accessible, and non-compliance can result in costly lawsuits. WCAG standards provide a clear benchmark for creating accessible websites, covering essential elements such as semantic HTML, ARIA, and compatibility with screen readers.</p>

                <p>Legal compliance is also not just a precautionary measure, it demonstrates your commitment to inclusivity and equality. By ensuring compliance, you protect your brand while promoting positive values.</p>

                <p>Accessibility isn’t just for people with disabilities, it enhances the experience for everyone. Features like clear navigation, headings, and mobile responsiveness make websites easier to use and understand. Research show that users of all abilities benefit from accessibility features, with improvements to engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty.</p>

                <p>By employing heuristics such as visibility, feedback, and consistency, you create a website that can intuitively guides users, whether they navigate with a mouse, keyboard, finger, or assistive technology.</p>

                <p>An accessible website opens your business to an audience of over 1 billion people with disabilities globally. This is not just a ethical goal but also a smart business move. According to research, people with disabilities have a combined spending power of over $8 trillion annually. By designing with accessibility in mind, you can tap into this market, enhancing your brand’s reputation and profitability.</p>

                <p>Additionally, search engines favor accessible websites, improving visibility to your site. By aligning with web standards and incorporating semantic HTML, your site can attract more users and expand its reach.</p>
